In this project I will analyze data for companies. A dataset containing information about each company on the INC 5000 list in 2019.
Fields include company name, industry, year of incorporation, website and location, as well as 2019 revenue, percentage growth, number of employees (annual growth) and number of years on the list.
Moreover I will respond on below questions:

1) What is the average revenue among the companies on the list? Distributed by industry?

  select 
      	industry
      	,avg(revenue) as Average_revenue
  from companies 
  group by industry

2) Which industries are most and least represented on the list?
The most represented on the list:

select 	
	industry
	,count(*) as Amount
from companies
group by industry 
order by Amount desc

The least represented on the list:

select 
	industry
	,count(*) as Amount
from companies
group by industry
order by Amount ASC

3) Which industries recorded the highest average growth rate?

select 	
	industry
	,avg(growth) as Average_of_growth_rate
from companies 
group by industry 
order by Average_of_growth_rate desc

4) Which ten companies had the largest increase in staff/new hires?

select 
	name
	,workers - previous_workers as increase_in_staff
from companies
order by increase_in_staff desc

	name
from companies 
where
